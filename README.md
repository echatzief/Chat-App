# Chat-App

# Getting-Started
* I created an app for chatting and sending images to all users or some selected user(Private).The communication between backend and frontend is based on Http request and socket.io.I also used a mongodb for the active users and for the messages.

# Running at localhost
* In order to run my project in to your localhost you need:

	cd Only-Text-Chat/ && npm install then npm start 

  or if you want to start the project with the image support :

	cd With-Images/ && npm install then npm start 

# Installing Prerequisites
* To run the project you also need to have installed :
  
	* node-js --> sudo apt-get install nodejs
	* npm     --> sudo apt-get install npm

* If you can install properly this prerequisites then you can run the   project easily nothing more is expected.
